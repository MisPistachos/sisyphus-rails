# Sisyphus::Rails

A gem to add gmail like form saving through sisyphus.js

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'sisyphus-rails'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install sisyphus-rails

For a basic install include the following in your ++app/assets/javascripts/application.js++ file

    //= require jstorage
    //= require sisyphus

## How it Works

Sisyphus uses an aliased form_tag method to automatically put a ++<script>...</script>++ tag infront of your forms. 

## Usage

Sisyphus automatically works with all your forms, including custom form builders. 

### Exclude form


## Dependencies

- Rails >= 3.1
- Jquery

## TODO

- Fix the double script tag issue caused by the initialization of the builder twice, once in form_for and once in fields_for right below it
- Tests
- Multiple library support for jStorage (Prototype, Mootools etc.)
- Support for formtastic and extending other form builders
- Model/Object based exclusions
